# /etc/firewall.user
# This file is interpreted as shell script.
# Put your custom iptables rules here, they will
# be executed with each firewall (re-)start.

# Internal uci firewall chains are flushed and recreated on reload, so
# put custom rules into the root chains e.g. INPUT or FORWARD or into the
# special user chains, e.g. input_wan_rule or postrouting_lan_rule.

# remove comments from rules, use dd as buffer
#iptables-save  | dd bs=256k 2> /dev/null | sed -e 's/-m comment --comment "\?[^"]\+"\? -j/-j/'  | iptables-restore
#ip6tables-save | dd bs=256k 2> /dev/null | sed -e 's/-m comment --comment "\?[^"]\+"\? -j/-j/' | ip6tables-restore
